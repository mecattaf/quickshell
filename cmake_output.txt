CMake Warning at /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake:247 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt6WaylandClient/Qt6WaylandClientConfig.cmake

  but it set Qt6WaylandClient_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6WaylandClient" is
  considered to be NOT FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Qt6WaylandClient could not be found because dependency Wayland could not be
  found.

  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Wayland might reveal details why the
  package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.
